# Doctor Avatar Images Needed

The following doctor avatar images are referenced in the messages screen but not yet added:

- doctor1.png (for Dr. Mohamed)
- doctor2.png (for Dr. Michel)  
- doctor3.png (for Dr. Hani Fares)
- doctor4.png (for Dr. Karim Ahmed)
- doctor5.png (for Dr. Weal Saber)
- doctor6.png (for Dr. Ramy Abbas)

These should be professional headshot photos, preferably:
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- At least 200x200 pixels
- Clear, professional appearance
- Consistent lighting and style

If images are not available, the app will fall back to gradient containers with doctor initials.
